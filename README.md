## Purpose

As an *aspiring developper*, the only purpose of thisproject is to conceive a very simple first toy app in order to let me discover the wonderful worl of programming in **Swift**.

## Strategy

The assumed strategy is to get the chance to make ***a lot of errors*** because that's the best way to learn.

## User manual

Type a phrase, and then chose between **UpperCamelCase** or **lowerCamelCase** and just enjoy the magic of a nice useless app!
